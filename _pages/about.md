Hi, I'm Anushri Suresh, a Computer Science master's student at <a href='https://www.jhu.edu/'>Johns Hopkins University</a>, where I'm currently associated with the <a href='https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/'>Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)</a> and the <a href='https://www.infini-ai-lab.cmu.edu/'>InfiniAI Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. I earned my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the <a href='https://www.nitt.edu/'>National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli</a>.

My work focuses on making machine learning more efficient. I am currently interested in optimizing large language model (LLM) inference and scaling strategies at test time. I've previously worked with the <a href='https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/'>ARCADE Lab</a> at JHU, <a href='https://www.bosch-softwaretechnologies.com/en/'>Bosch</a>, and the <a href='https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/aiml.html'>AI/ML Group at the University of Zurich</a>, contributing across research and applied ML settings.

### Research Interests

- Large Language Model Optimization
- Efficient Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Test-time Adaptation Strategies
